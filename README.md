# MongoDB $inc Operator with String Value

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in MongoDB update operations involving the `$inc` operator. The error arises from using a string value where a number is expected, leading to unexpected behavior without explicit error messages.

## Bug Description
The `$inc` operator is designed to increment a numerical field by a specified value. Attempting to increment using a string results in the update operation failing silently, leaving the field unchanged.  This can be difficult to debug as there are no immediate errors reported.

## Bug Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code demonstrating the problem. To reproduce the issue:

1. Ensure a MongoDB instance is running and accessible.
2. Create a collection (e.g., `myCollection`).
3. Insert a document with a numeric field, such as `{ _id: 1, counter: 0 }`.
4. Run the `bug.js` script using a MongoDB driver (e.g., Node.js driver).
5. Verify that the `counter` field remains unchanged after running the script.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides the correct implementation, using a numerical value with the `$inc` operator. This ensures that the field is incremented as intended. 

## Fixing the issue
Always ensure that values used with the `$inc` operator are numeric types (integer, double, etc.).  Data validation on the application side can help prevent this kind of error.
